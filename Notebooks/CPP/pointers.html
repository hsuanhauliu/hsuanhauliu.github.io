            A pointer variable is a variable that contains the address of the memory location of an area of memory where the data is stored.
            Pointers are heavily used in some data structures (linked list, for example), and are really useful for passing by reference.
            It can also be used to point to dynamically created objects (create nodes for a link list object).
            When it is used to point to a static variable, you have created a variable that shares the same memory with that static variable.
            Note that when this method is used, the data changes if you modify either of the two variables (the static variable and the pointer).
            This can be potentially disasterous if not careful.

          <p>Pointers example:</p>
          <div class="codesnippet">
            <pre class="prettyprint">
// Point at static variable.
int test1 = 1;
int* pointer1 = &test1; // copy the address of test1 to the pointer
cout << "Static variable:"<< *pointer1 << endl << endl;

// Point at dynamic object.
int* pointer2 = new int(2); // dynamically create an int object
cout << "Dynamic object: " << *pointer2 << endl; // print the object that it's pointing to
cout << "Object address: " << pointer2 << endl << endl; // print the address that is stored in the pointer

// Point at a struct object.
Node* point3 = new Node(3);
cout << "Dynamic struct: " << point3->value << endl;
            </pre>
          </div><br>

          <p>Result:</p>
          <div class="codesnippet">
            <pre class="prettyprint">
Static variable: 1

Dynamic object: 2
Object address: 0x7f9d60c02640

Dynamic struct: 3
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p>*Note that the address is just some arbitrary memory address.</p><br>
