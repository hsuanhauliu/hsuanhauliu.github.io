                    My name is Hsuan-Hau Liu (劉軒豪). I go by the name Howard.
                    I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Auburn University, majoring in Computer Science.
                    Midway through my undergraduate years at Auburn, I discovered my passion and potential in programming.
                    It is at that moment, I decided to switch from Electrical engineering major to Computer Science.
                    Throughout my senior year, I have developed the skills needed to become a successful computer scientist.
                    By the end of December, 2017, I will be graduating from Auburn University with a BS in Computer Science.
                    In Spring 2018, I will be pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, specializing in Intelligent Robotics.
                    <br><br>
                    My interests in the field of Computer Science include: Artificial Intelligence, Networking, Web development, and Computer Security.
                    I decided to go into Artificial Intelligence, due to its freshness and enormous potential.
                    The challenge and excitement that this area has to offer is simply too tempting.
                    In the future, I hope to use my skills to develop new techonology based on AI and make contribution to the advancement of society.

                  <p>
                    I was born in Taiwan and lived there for the first 14 years of my life.
                    My brother and I were both raised by my mother and grandparents, who we love dearly.
                    I attended elementary and middle school while I was still living in Taiwan.
                    When I was 14, I moved to the U.S. and studied at Army and Nevy Academy in Carlsbad, California.

                  <p>
                    My favorite programming language is C++ due to its speed and high-level syntax.
                    Currently I'm in the process of learning Python through AI class project and Javascript through web development.
                    I normally program on a Mac with VIM in terminal.
                    With the help of a terminal application called Tmux, I can have two windows side by side: one for coding and one for testing.
                    In a Windows environment, I use Visual Studio to code.
                    For projects, I like to use Github for code sharing and program development.

                    I also played the clarinet in the highschool marching band when I was a freshman, as well as the organ in my senior year in high school.

                    I also plan to write some basic guides on the things that I learn, to serve as notes as well as tutorials for other people.
