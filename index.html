              Hey there! My name is Hsuan-Hau Liu (劉軒豪), nickname Howard.
              I am currently a CS Master's student at the University of Southern California, specializing in Intelligent Robotics.
              I love coding and learning everything I can about computers.
              Mainly, I focus on Artificial Intelligence, Web development, and Networking.
              In the future, I hope to use my skills to develop new AI techonology and make contribution to the advancement of our society.

              I was born in Taiwan and raised by my mother and grandparents, whom I love dearly.
              Came to the U.S. for education when I was about 14 years old.

            <p>
              My favorite programming language is C++ due to its speed and high-level syntax.
              I have done a few projects using Java, C.
              Occasionally, I use Python to write simple scripts for myself and sometimes during coding practice.
              Sometimes I write websites for myself using HTML, CSS, minimal Javascript, Bootstrap, SQL, etc.

              My programming tools are VIM, tmux, inside of a terminal on my Macbook Pro.
              In a Windows environment, I use Visual Studio to code.
              For projects, I like to use Github for code sharing and program development.
